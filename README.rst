Introduction

KML is an XML geospatial data format and an OGC_ standard that deserves a canonical python implementation.

Fastkml is a library to read, write and manipulate KML files. It aims to keep
it simple and fast (using lxml_ if available). Fast refers to the time you
spend to write and read KML files as well as the time you spend to get
acquainted to the library or to create KML objects. It aims to provide all of
the functionality that KML clients such as `Marble <https://marble.kde.org/>`_, `OpenLayers
<http://openlayers.org/>`_, `Google Maps <http://maps.google.com/>`_, and
`Google Earth <http://earth.google.com/>`_ provides.

For more details about the KML Specification, check out the `KML Reference
<https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference>`_ on the Google
developers site.

Geometries are handled as pygeoif_ objects.

Fastkml is continually tested

Documentation
=============

You can find all of the documentation for FastKML at `fastkml.readthedocs.org
<https://fastkml.readthedocs.org>`_. If you find something that is missing,
please submit a pull request on `GitHub <https://github.com/cleder/fastkml>`_
with the improvement.


Install
========

You can install the package with ``pip install fastkml`` which will pull in all requirements.

Requirements
-------------

* pygeoif_
* arrow_

Optional
---------

* lxml_::

    pip install --pre "fastkml[lxml]"

Limitations
===========

Currently, the only major feature missing for the full Google Earth experience
is the `gx extension
<https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#kmlextensions>`_.
Please submit a PR with the features you'd like to see implemented.
