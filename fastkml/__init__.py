"""
Fastkml is a library to read, write and manipulate kml files.

It aims to keep it simple and fast (using lxml if available).
Fast refers to the time you spend to write and read KML files as well as the time
you spend to get acquainted to the library or to create KML objects.
It provides a subset of KML and is aimed at documents that can be read from
multiple clients such as openlayers and google maps rather than to give you all
functionality that KML on google earth provides.
