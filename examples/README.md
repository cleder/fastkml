# Usage Examples for FastKML

The `KML_Samples.kml` file was found in [Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/KML_Samples.kml) site.


The data for the `shp2kml` examples was obtained from
[Data on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/co2-data)
and the shapefile (Small scale data, 1:110m) from
[Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/).
The data provided in this directory is only a small subset of that data just enough
to create the KML.
